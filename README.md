# Git-Github

## About
I created this repository to hold information I kept forgetting when I would take long breaks from Github or have to set up Git Bash on a new system. The purpose is to be a useful reference/reminder of how Git and Github can be used/works.

If you'd like to contribute to this then let me know, although I'm not sure if I'll be around to accept pull requests so you're probably better off just Forking this for and modifying it for your own use. 

If there are any mistakes/errors with type-o's/syntax or in the explainations, please let me know. Thank you!
